# Before the semester starts
## Figure out when and where your classes meet
Head to the college website.  Select “I am a current student” option.  Then, select the WebAdvisor tile; it looks like this.  Next, click on the Log In link in the upper right corner; it looks like this.  In the Registration section, look for the Register or Drop Sections link; it looks like this.  That should bring you to a calendar view of the courses you signed up for; it looks like this.  Click on the Meeting Information link to show the time and location.  You can print a copy of your schedule:  look for a Print button in the upper left corner.
If you need help with any of these steps, call the college’s HelpDesk ((315) 498-2999).

## Figure out how to get to campus & find your classes on campus
Here’s a copy of the campus map, to help you locate the buildings--and the parking lots.
If you are planning to drive to campus, don’t forget to pick up your free parking permit at Student Central in Gordon building.
Public transportation to campus is available.
If you are not familiar with the bus system in Syracuse, consider using Google Maps and choosing the Public transit option.
If it is your first time on campus, budget additional 30+ minutes to find parking, the building, and the classroom.

## Start thinking about how you will schedule your time during the semester
College classes are time-consuming.  Watch this video 4 Steps to Start a New Semester (The Right Way) (first 5 min) to get an idea of how to handle that.
if you want to get started on building your own calendar, here’s the link to the Calendar assignment; it is going to be due at the end of the first week
To build a realistic schedule, it helps to know how much time is taken by your everyday activities.  How long does it take you to get ready in the morning?  How long does grocery shopping take?  Laundy?  Family time?
You can start by keeping a mental record of this, but if you are a fan of apps, I would suggest the Toggl Track app (free version).

## Freshen up your typing skills & and your “get-back-up-after-falling” skills
OK, this is an odd request.  I’d like you to spend some time on https://www.keybr.com, a website that teaches touch-typing and improves typing speed and accuracy.
It is free.  Registering (also free) allows you to keep track of your progress even if you clear the browsing history.
Why?
Because typing a 10-page research paper with two fingers takes a really long time.
Because you need to get some practice making mistakes.

Learning happens at the edge of what you already can do, which is to say that learning requires trying and making mistakes.

keybr.com is a perfect opportunity to practice making mistakes.  It is based on the idea that you can make the most progress by working on things that are not working yet.  So mistakes are guaranteed--and so is fast learning.

As you practice typing, work on rewiring your response to mistakes.  When most people make a mistake, they get flustered, speed up, and make more mistakes.  Let’s try the opposite.  Try to slow down after a mistake.  Ask yourself if there is a particular reason you made the mistake.  Replay the same combination of keys slower, until you are more comfortable with it.  Then, gradually build the speed. Take a step back so that you can take two steps forward.

As you are making mistakes and then working through them, you may be able to separate yourself from your mistakes:  you are making the mistakes because they are trying something new, not because there is something wrong with you.  With luck, you will start seeing mistakes as opportunities, rather than threats.

Check your profile page every once in a while.  Often, the progress we make in one session is hard to see.  Sometimes we hit a plateau and sometimes we backslide as we are working through some thorny issues.  So take time occasionally to look back at your entire journey.  See how far you can come by doing a little bit every day.

# Start of semester
## When does the semester start?
Fall 2022 semester starts on Mon, Aug 29, 2022
Both lecture and lab start on Week 1

## When and where does this class meet?
To help you locate the building on campus, here’s a campus map.
To help you locate the rooms in the building, here’s Ferrante’s floor plan.
Lecture
Mon-Wed lecture:  9:35 am - 11:00 am, in Ferrante 259
Thu-Thu day lecture:  1:30 pm - 2:55 pm, in Performance 108
Tue-Thu evening lecture:  6:15 pm - 7:40 pm, in Ferrante 259
Lab:  all labs meet in Ferrante 240
Mon lab:  1:30 pm - 4:00 pm
Tue day lab:  3:05-5:35 pm
Tue evening lab:  7:50 pm - 10:20 pm
Wed lab:  1:30 pm - 4:00 pm

## Do I have to wear a mask to class?
No, masks are optional on campus.
Do I have to be vaccinated to attend classes on campus?
Yes.  Full vaccination against covid is required.

## I missed the first class, first lab, or the entire first week.  What should I do? #missed first class #missed first week
Please log into D2L.  Once you are in the course shell, read the announcements for Week 1.  It covers in detail what we are doing in each lecture and  lab, what is due at the end of this week--and how to catch up on your own if you miss anything.
This class has a generous late work policy, but I would encourage you not to put things off.  You don’t want to be running after the train for the rest of the semester.



## What are the required materials and recommended materials for BIO-121?
recommended textbook: Hoefnagels, Mariëlle. Biology:  The Essentials, any edition.
All the necessary information will be provided in the lecture and lab handouts, so the textbook is recommended but not required.  If you find it helpful to be able to consult the textbook and would like to buy a copy, here are the options:
If you sign up for Box of Books, you will automatically get a semester-long access to an electronic copy of the textbook ($86).
If you want a printed copy of the textbook, the campus bookstore may have new copies ($28) and used copies ($22).
If the campus bookstore runs out of those, you can order a used copy of a previous edition (ISBN-13: 978-0078024252) from Amazon.com for under $15.
Look for copies in Good condition or better; excessive highlighting may be distracting.
Factor in shipping time:  it may take up to 2 weeks.
If you want an electronic copy of the textbook without going through Box of Books, Amazon.com has them for rent ($29) or sale ($33).  (If you want to buy, click on the “Buy” button above the “Rent” button.)
Printed copies of the book are available on reserve in the college library.  You can check them out for up to 3 hours at a time.  The reserves desk is located on the 2nd floor of Coulter.  Bring your college ID.

required:
3-ring binder:  consider getting a 1.5 or 2-inch binder; this is large enough to hold all the handouts
binder dividers:  consider getting plastic binders, since they are more durable
pens (2-3 different colors) for lectures and regular pencils for lab
access to a computer with a mouse:  if you do not have your own computer, you can use computers on campus
Why a mouse?  Many of the assignments in this class will be done on a computer.  Unless you are really comfortable using your laptop’s trackpad, a mouse will make the experience less frustrating.  You can pick up a wireless mouse for $10-20--or stick with campus computers for those assignments.
a Google account:  many of the assignments in this course will be shared as Google Docs.  If you are using Gmail, you have a Google account already.  If you don’t, you can create an account here.  Google accounts are free.
RemNote license:  RemNote is an app for taking notes and making flashcards.  I am working with the campus bookstore to include it in the Box of Books bundle.  If that does not happen, RemNote will move into Recommended materials.  Do not purchase the license on your own:  you will be provided with a discount link.
Technology
## Where can I use a computer or a printer on campus?
Coulter library has computers on the 2nd and 3rd floor.  Ask a librarian to point you in the right direction.
You can print on campus; the first 250 pages are free.  You automatically get a printing allowance each semester that is enough to print 250 double-sided black-and-white pages.  Color is a lot more expensive.
Loaner laptops are available.
You can check out a Chromebook at the library (1st floor circulation desk). (Student ID is required to check things out.)
If you need a PC, fill out a loaner request form, which can be found on the library’s page.

## I don’t have Word, PowerPoint, or other Microsoft software on my computer.  What can I do?
The college provides free copies of Microsoft software to students; download it here: http://getoffice.sunyocc.edu
click on Install Office button in the upper right corner of the page
For this course, you may want to download Microsoft Word (word processing app), PowerPoint (slides app), and OneNote (note management app)
Downloads are available for PC and Mac; Chromebook users can use web versions of the apps

## All Blackboard emails go to OCC email, but I don’t check it often.  What can I do?
Set up email forwarding from your OCC email to your personal email.  It takes just a few minutes, and it would allow you to receive all the communications--Announcements, reminders, etc--in a timely manner.
Alternatively, you can change your preferred email address in MyOCC.  By default, it is set to your OCC address, but you can replace it with your personal email address.
Office Hours and the Learning Center

## When are your office hours?  Where?  Why?  Is an appointment required?
When:
Mon & Wed morning, 11:15 am - 12:15 pm
Thu afternoon, 3:00 pm - 6:00 pm
If you had completed the Calendar assignment during Week 1, you’ve already added the Office Hours calendar to your personal calendar.  Consulting the calendar may be the easiest way to figure out when are the next office hours that fit your schedule
Where:  my office, in Ferrante 236
Why?  Watch this video.  (Seriously, though, if you wake up in the middle of the night, wondering what you got yourself into, come to office hours.)
No appointment is necessary for in-person office hours.  Just come by!
If you cannot attend in person and would like to meet on Zoom instead, email me at least one day in advance.  Here’s the Zoom meeting link.

## Are you available on Zoom during office hours?
The plan is to have in-person office hours this semester, but I will be available by Zoom as well, if you make an appointment in advance.  Here’s the Zoom meeting link.
If you haven’t used Zoom before or need a refresher, here’s a guide to Zoom.

## Your office hours do not fit my schedule.  Can we make an appointment?
Yes, we can meet by appointment.  To schedule a time, talk to me before or after class.  Alternatively, email me with a list of 2-3 times when you are available, and I will try to find a time that works for us both.  (Please let me know whether you are available in person, on Zoom, or either one.)
If you are making an appointment over email, please give me an indication of what you would like to talk about.  There is a chance that I may be able to address your needs right away over email.
Once we agree on the time, I will email you a meeting invite.  Please accept the invite (click on “Yes”); this will make it appear in your calendar.  Consider adding your own Notification, so that you won’t forget the meeting.

## Where is the Learning Center?  When is it open?  How do I make an appointment with a tutor?
Where:  The Learning Center is located in Gordon 202, just past the cafeteria.  (Here’s a copy of the campus map to help you find the building.)
When:  Check the Learning Center’s website for their current hours.
To make an appointment, stop by at the front desk (Gordon 202), call ((315) 498-2103), email (learningcenter@sunyocc.edu), or book an appointment online.
If this is your first time making an appointment online, you will find directions on how to register, log in, and make an appointment near the top of the appointment-making page. If you need help with any of those, stop by the Learning Center’s front desk or my office hours.
